                <p>I have developed a methodical approach to working through my degree, as well as gained key analytical and
                    communication skills through my one-year industry placement. My long-term career goal is specialised software
                    development in areas such as AI or Cyber Security. I have an eagerness to innovate and actively contribute to the
                    overall success of a business. I use my own initiative when designing and implementing new solutions, whilst
                    working in a collaborative environment.</p>
